# <ASSIGNMENT 2.4: Write a feature description of your proposed improvement>

Feature: Integrate a community feedback system for predictions
    In order to leverage collective knowledge
    As a mushroom forager
    I want to integrate a community feedback system within the user interface

    Scenario: Allow users to submit feedback on predictions
        Given I have received predictions for new data
        When I click the "Submit Feedback" button
        Then I can provide my insights on the accuracy of the predictions
        And I can rate the predictions on a scale from 1 to 5 stars

    Scenario: Display community insights and trends
        Given I have accessed the prediction results page
        When I view the community insights section
        Then I see a summary of feedback from other users about the prediction accuracy
        And I can view trending patterns in predictions based on community ratings
